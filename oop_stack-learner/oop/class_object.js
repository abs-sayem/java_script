// We can create an object like:
const person = {}

/* 
 * const = keyword that construct the object
 * person = is the name of the object, by which we will call it further
 * {} = we can pass the values of the attributes of the class the object created from
*/

// Give some attributes of the object:
person.name  = "Mahareen Siddiq Laiba"
person.email = "mahareenlaiba@gmail.com"
person.phone = "01825507837"

// Lets see them from console:
console.log(person)

// So, in this way we can create an object and give it some attributes and corresponding values.
